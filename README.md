Multithreaded App to calculate highest mark of students


For my school assignment, I built a multithreaded app using POSIX threads in C to calculate the highest scoring student by collecting and comparing a student's assignment, midterm, project and final grades and comparing the averages against other students and picking the highest one. The user can choose the number of students and can enter each grade for each student.
